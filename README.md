# üí´ Power BI Sales Analysis

Hey there! I‚Äôm working on a Power BI project to analyze sales data and gain insights into sales trends, profit margins, quantity sold, and much more using DAX measures. This project focuses on leveraging Power BI‚Äôs capabilities to build dynamic dashboards, track key metrics, and provide actionable insights for decision-makers.

## Datasets 

Fact Table
Stores quantitative data for analysis, such as sales, profit, and transaction details.
Dimension Tables:
Dim Product
Dim Customers
Dim Promotion
These tables are connected to the Fact Table for detailed analysis and reporting.

Relationships
The fact table connects to each dimension table, allowing for detailed analysis and reporting. For example, you can analyze sales by product, customer demographics, and promotional effectiveness over time.

Here is the data set used [Store+Data.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18923116/Store%2BData.xlsx)

## What I‚Äôm Working On:
In this project, I'm building several DAX measures to answer key business questions related to sales data. The focus areas include:

1) **Top/Bottom 5 Product by Sales/Profit/Quantity Sold**

   This report provides insights into the top and bottom products based on sales, profit, or quantity sold.

2) **How Do Sales Trends Vary Over Time (Daily, Monthly, Quarterly, Annually)?**

   Here, I analyze how sales change over time across different periods like daily, monthly, quarterly, and annually.

3) **Show Sales by Different Cities**

   This measure visualizes how sales vary across different cities.

4) **Show Relationship Between Sales & Profit**

   A report that shows the correlation between sales and profit.

5) **Compare Sales/Profit/Quantity Sold Between Any Two Periods Selected by the User**

   Users can select two time periods, and the report will show comparisons for sales, profit, and quantity sold.

6) **Average Discount Offered in Each Discount Category**

   This measure calculates the average discount applied across different categories.

7) **Show Sales/Profit/Discount/Net Sales/All Remaining Fields for Each Order**

   This report allows filtering by product, date, customer ID, and promotion categories.
